abstract = {Swarm intelligence is a relatively new approach to problem solving that takes inspiration from the social behaviors of insects and of other animals. In particular, ants have inspired a number of methods and techniques among which the most studied and the most successful is the general purpose optimization technique known as ant colony optimization. Ant colony optimization (ACO) takes inspiration from the foraging behavior of some ant species. These ants deposit pheromone on the ground in order to mark some favorable path that should be followed by other members of the colony. Ant colony optimization exploits a similar mechanism for solving optimization problems. From the early nineties, when the first ant colony optimization algorithm was proposed, ACO attracted the attention of increasing numbers of researchers and many successful applications are now available. Moreover, a substantial corpus of theoretical results is becoming available that provides useful guidelines to researchers and practitioners in further applications of ACO. The goal of this article is to introduce ant colony optimization and to survey its most notable applications},

	abstract = {Before beginning any robot task, users must position the robot's base, a task that now depends entirely on user intuition. While slight perturbation is tolerable for robots with moveable bases, correcting the problem is imperative for fixed-base robots if some essential task sections are out of reach. For mobile manipulation robots, it is necessary to decide on a specific base position before beginning manipulation tasks. This paper presents Reuleaux, an open source library for robot reachability analyses and base placement. It reduces the amount of extra repositioning and removes the manual work of identifying potential base locations. Based on the reachability map, base placement locations of a whole robot or only the arm can be efficiently determined. This can be applied to both statically mounted robots, where position of the robot and work piece ensure the maximum amount of work performed, and to mobile robots, where the maximum amount of workable area can be reached. Solutions are not limited only to vertically constrained placement, since complicated robotics tasks require the base to be placed at unique poses based on task demand. All Reuleaux library methods were tested on different robots of different specifications and evaluated for tasks in simulation and real world environment. Evaluation results indicate that Reuleaux had significantly improved performance than prior existing methods in terms of time-efficiency and range of applicability.},

Previous approaches to the solution are based on the idea of sampling and inverting the task constraint to build a roadmap of task-constrained configurations which are then connected by simple local paths; hence, task tracking is not enforced during the motion between samples. Here, we present a control-based randomized approach relying on a motion generation scheme that guarantees continued satisfaction of such constraint. The resulting planner allows to achieve accurate execution of the desired task without increasing the size of the roadmap.

The first aspect is important from the economical point of view, while the second is requested to satisfy technical specifications. Aiming at increasing the robot performance, a strategy that maximizes the manipulator accuracy and minimizes the mechanical power consumption is considered in this work. The end-effector is constrained to follow a predefined path during the optimal task positioning. The proposed strategy defines a relation between mechanical power and manipulability as a key element of the manipulator analysis, establishing a performance index for a rigid body transformation. This transformation is used to compute the optimal task positioning through the optimization of a multicriteria objective function.

When workspace representations, e.g. the reachability of an arm, are considered, additional quality information such as manipulability or self- distance can be employed to enrich the spatial data. In this work we present an approach of inverting such precomputed reachability representations in order to generate suitable robot base positions for grasping. Compared to existing works, our approach is able to generate a distribution in SE(2), the cross-space consisting of 2D position and 1D orientation, that describes potential robot base poses together with a quality index. We show how this distribution can be queried quickly in order to find oriented base poses from which a target grasping pose is reachable without collisions. The approach is evaluated in simulation using the humanoid robot ARMAR-III [1] and an extension is presented that allows to find suitable base poses for trajectory execution.},

	abstract = {Milling performed with robots is quite demanding, even for low-strength materials, due to the high accuracy requirements, the generally high and periodically varying milling forces and the low stiffness of robots compared to CNC machine tools. In view of the generally improved recently robot stiffness, it is desirable to perform the milling operation in regions of the robot's workspace where manipulability, both kinematic and dynamic, is highest, thereby exhausting the robot's potential to cope with the process. In addition, by selecting the most suitable initial pose of the robot with respect to the workpiece, a reduction in the range of necessary joint torques may be reached, to the extent of alleviating the heavy requirements on the robot. Two genetic algorithms (GAs) are employed to tackle these problems. The values of several robot variables, such as joint positions and torques, which are needed by the genetic algorithms, are calculated using inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics models. In addition, initial positions and poses leading to singularities along the milling path are penalized and, thus, avoided. The first GA deals solely with robot kinematics to maximize manipulability. The second GA takes into account milling forces, which are computed numerically according to the particular milling parameters, to minimise joint torque loads. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Diverse manipulation actions are required, e.g. simple pick and place for moving objects and constrained motions for opening doors and drawers. The robot kinematics and link limits however are restrictive. Therefore especially a constrained trajectory will not be executable from arbitrary placements of the mobile manipulator. A two stage approach is presented to position a mobile manipulator to execute constrained linear trajectories as needed for opening drawers. In a first stage, a representation of a robot armpsilas reachable workspace is computed. Pattern recognition techniques are used to find regions in the workspace representation where these trajectories are possible. A set of trajectories results. In the second stage mobile manipulator placements are computed and the corresponding trajectories are checked for collisions. Compared to a brute force search through the workspace, the success rate of finding a mobile manipulator placement can be increased from 2{\%} to 70{\%}.},

In robotics, coordinates are used to describe the kinematic structure and the kinematic and dynamic behavior. The description mostly takes place in charts, assigned by the observer of the robotic system. However, it is crucial that the described physical process does not depend on the coordinate choice of the observer. In this work we show the relation between coordinates and manipulability analysis. Manipulability measures are dependent of joint coordinates of the robot and task coordinates in the workspace of the robot. Both relations can be analyzed with tensor geometry. We remove the dependency on joint coordinates through the use of an appropriate metric. With the help of tensor contraction, the resulting induced metric in the workspace can be transformed into a coordinate invariant matrix. After applying eigenvalue decomposition on this matrix, we can visualize the dynamic manipulability of a robot as a coordinate invariant ellipsoid."

abstract = "TheL2-discrepancy for anchored axis-parallel boxes has been used in several recent computational studies, mostly related to numerical integration, as a measure of the quality of uniform distribution of a given point set. We point out that if the number of points is not large enough in terms of the dimension (e.g., fewer than 104points in dimension 30) then nearly the lowest possibleL2-discrepancy is attained by a pathological point set, and hence theL2-discrepancy may not be very relevant for relatively small sets. Recently, Hickernell obtained a formula for the expectedL2-discrepancy of certain randomized low-discrepancy set constructions introduced by Owen. We note that his formula remains valid also for several modifications of these constructions which admit a very simple and efficient implementation. We also report results of computational experiments with various constructions of low-discrepancy sets. Finally, we present a fairly precise formula for the performance of a recent algorithm due to Heinrich for computing theL2-discrepancy."
